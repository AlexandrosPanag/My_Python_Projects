Tree Traversal Algorithms
----

Tree traversal involves searching a tree data structure one node at a time, performing functions like checking the node for data or updating the node. There are two common classifications for tree traversal algorithms: Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). Depth-first search starts with the root node and first visits all nodes on one branch before backtracking. Breadth-first search starts from the root node and visits all nodes at its current depth before moving to the next depth in the tree.
