Basics
------------------------------------------------

A folder with all the basic learning difficulty projects that i made



Numbers
----
A basic explanation of declaration and the variable type


Arithmetic Operations In Python
---
Intermediate level mathematical operations in python & examples of how mathematical operations work and how we can print them

Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
---
A basic program using user input that can make Celsius to Fahrenheit 


Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
---
A basic program using user input that can make Fahrenheit to Celcius 



Walrus Operator
---

Walrus Operator ":=" allows you to assign values to variables within an expression including variables that do not yet exit 


Boolean Operator
---

There are two Boolean values : True & False. They can be created by comparing values , for instance by using the equal operator ==.


If_Else Statements
---

Basic format of how we can use if & else statements in Python 



Elif Statements
---

The elif (short for else if) statement is a shortcut to use when chaining if and else statements making the code shorter and easier to be understood. the same code from "if else statements" can be written using the Elif statement


Boolean Operator AND OR NOT
---

Python's boolean logic operators are AND , OR & NOT they are used to make more complicated programs




Basic User Input Calculator
---

A program that does basic arithmetic operations between two user input-given numbers



Sets_Exanmple
---

Lists and tuples are standard Python data types that store values in a sequence. Sets are another standard Python data type that also store values. The major difference is that sets, unlike lists or tuples, cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element and store unordered values.

This is a basic example of how we can use sets


Calculating A Mathematical Function
---

This is a basic example of how we can calculate a mathematical function in python



Quadratic Equation
---

This is a basic illustration of how we can fully utilize quadratic equations and solve them using python



For I in Range
---

This is an example of how we can use the for i in range command properly differently and at the same time, get different results

Eternal While User Input
---

This is an example of a program, that takes user input and then checks if the user gave a specific value or not, if the user didn't give a specific value, then the program will continue to run eternally


While Loop Defense Programming
---

A method to prevent the user from giving a value that we don't want for our program (in this case a double digit number), if the user doesn't give a specific value (again, in this case a double digit number) then the program will fail to progress further


While Multiple Input Choice
---

A program that checks multiple inputs to check whether or not a condition has been met. If a condition has been met, then the program will end, otherwise it will continue to run forever

Find Primes until Its Filled
---

A program that can find the prime numbers until our array size is filled

Random Number Generation
---

A program that generates 10 random numbers from 0 to 100 set as range
