Big O Notation
-----------

Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run when the input tends towards a specific or limiting value. It calculates the time taken to execute each code statement in an algorithm.

Big O Notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms. It calculates the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows. In other words, it calculates the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. 

Big O Notation in Data Structure describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime. It calculates the time and amount of memory needed to execute the algorithm for an input value.
