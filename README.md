What is Python? Executive Summary
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

Numbers
----
A basic explanation of declaration and the variable type


Arithmetic Operations In Python
---
Intermediate level mathematical operations in python & examples of how mathematical operations work and how we can print them

Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
---
A basic program using user input that can make Celsius to Fahrenheit 


Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
---
A basic program using user input that can make Fahrenheit to Celcius 



Walrus Operator
---

Walrus Operator ":=" allows you to assign values to variables within an expression including variables that do not yet exit 


Boolean Operator
---

There are two Boolean values : True & False. They can be created by comparing values , for instance by using the equal operator ==.


If_Else Statements
---

Basic format of how we can use if & else statements in Python 



Elif Statements
---

The elif (short for else if) statement is a shortcut to use when chaining if and else statements making the code shorter and easier to be understood. the same code from "if else statements" can be written using the Elif statement


Boolean Operator AND OR NOT
---

Python's boolean logic operators are AND , OR & NOT they are used to make more complicated programs


Neat String Commands
---

A few neat string commands in order to alter the string formatting



Basic User Input Calculator
---

A program that does basic arithmetic operations between two user input-given numbers




Lists
---

This is a basic illustration of how we can use lists and a few useful list commands in order to append, extend , remove and pop out elements from our list


Lists - Part Two
---

A few useful list commands like sort, reverse in order to rearrange our elements and sort them out



Sets_Exanmple
---

Lists and tuples are standard Python data types that store values in a sequence. Sets are another standard Python data type that also store values. The major difference is that sets, unlike lists or tuples, cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element and store unordered values.

This is a basic example of how we can use sets


Calculating A Mathematical Function
---

This is a basic example of how we can calculate a mathematical function in python



Quadratic Equation
