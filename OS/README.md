OS Library
-------------------------

This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open(), if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput module. For creating temporary files and directories see the tempfile module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.

OS File Printing
----

This program shows how we can use the os library to find & output programs in a chosen path file. For example, a user can give the input C:\Users\<yourownusername>\Desktop and then output all the file locations on the list


OS File Printing Better
-----

A better implementation of the previous code (OS File Printing) that can discover programs on the user input given path file and then output the total number of files that were discovered


OS File Format
-----

A file format countering program that outputs how many different file format types we contain in a path (for example 3 PDFs, 1 .ini file, 6 .ino files etc etc)


OS File Format And Size
-----


A file format countering program that outputs how many different file format types we contain in a path (for example 3 PDFs, 1 .ini file, 6 .ino files etc etc), plus, the total size that they consume on our path location in percentage form
